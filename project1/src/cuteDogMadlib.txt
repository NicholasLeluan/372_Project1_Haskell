Anyone who doesnt think dogs are the cutest is a <ADJ> person
Even <PLURAL NOUN> think dogs are the cutest!
To put it <ADVERB> , cats and fish aren't that bad either.
And between you and me, <NOUN> are top tier as well. 
But nonetheless, when a cute dog <VERB> at you, you know you're special.
Shout out to all the <NOUNS> out there.
Without their perfect <COLOR> eyes, this world would be lesser.
Don't be a <ADJ> person, agree that dogs are the cutest
